# Superstore-Sales-Analysis
Using Microsoft SQL server to Analyze the Sales of a superstore from 2014-2017.
The goal of the analysis was to determine how the superstore can improve their sales using data from the previous years.
The data was gotten from Kaggle.com

# The insights I provided in the analysis includes:
      1. Sales and profit by month
      2. Year-over-Year Sales and Profit Growth
      3. Top 5 customers by purchases made
      4. Sales by Category and Sub-Category
      5. Sales by Location(Region, State, Cities)
      
      
# The steps I took to perform the analysis includes:
      1. Loaded the data into the superstore database in MS-SQL Server
      2. Data cleaning on the dataset which included removing redundant column, removing duplicate rows, fixing datatypes, e.t.c
      3. Exploratory data analysis on the data using T-SQL queries to identify patterns and trend in the data.
      4. Exported the clean data into Power Query
      5. Created a calendar table for ease of analysis
      6. Designed a dashboard using the important metrics
      
 Here's a preview of the dashboard:
